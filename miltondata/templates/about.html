    <h2>About ${c.site_title}</h2>

    <h3><a id="who"></a>Who's Behind This</h3>
    <p>${c.site_title} was the brainchild of <a href="http://austgate.co.uk/">Iain Emsley</a> and lives at the <a href="http://www.okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. It was developed with the help of some dedicated volunteers with particular credit going to <a href="http://www.rufuspollock.org/">Rufus Pollock</a>.
    </p>
